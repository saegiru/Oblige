WORK IN PROGRESS
================


Monsters
--------

+  more sophisticated handling of monster roles
   [ e.g. eventually use Archviles in cages and traps ]

-  a big boss fight every half-episode



Miscellaneous
-------------

-  void up cages in secret rooms (most of the time)

-  assign a floor chunk for boss fights

-  get posts working with rail junctions again

-  scenic: need posts where two different floor heights meet



Web Site
--------

-  update Usage page on THEME setting, e.g.:

   the "Jumbled" theme setting means each map's theme is chosen purely
   randomly (and usually different from the last), where "bit mixed" means groups of maps (2-4)
   have the same theme before choosing a new (random) one.  The "xxx-ish"
   settings means you get mostly "xxx" but with an occasionally different one
   thrown in.
