TEXTURE COORDINATE SYSTEM
=========================

'u' means horizontal offset / position
'v' means vertical offset / position (Z axis)

side texture: u1 and u2 in brush sides
              v1 and v2 in brush sides

bottom texture: bu, bv fields in brush sides
top    texture: tu, tv fields in brush sides

(tu/tv and bu/bv must occur in every side, or be absent from
 every side)
